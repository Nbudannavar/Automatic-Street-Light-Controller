# Automatic Street Light Control System

## 🔍 Overview
This project automatically turns ON the street light in the dark and turns it OFF when there is daylight using LDR and transistor/Arduino-based control.

## 🛠 Components Used
- LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)
- Transistor / Arduino (if used)
- LED or Bulb
- Resistors
- Breadboard and Wires
- Power supply

## ⚙️ Working Principle
The LDR senses darkness. When light intensity decreases, resistance increases, triggering the circuit to switch ON the light automatically.

## 📁 Files Included
- Circuit Diagram
- Arduino Code (if used)
- Component List
- Project Report PDF
- Working Images
