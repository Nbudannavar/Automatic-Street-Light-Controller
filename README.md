# Automatic-Street-Light-Controller
The Automatic Street Light Control System is designed to automatically control outdoor lighting depending on the surrounding light conditions. The system is built using an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) as the primary sensing element, along with an Arduino microcontroller that decides when to switch the street light ON or OFF.
